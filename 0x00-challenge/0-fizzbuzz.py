I see two issues with the code:

The first if statement in the for loop checks if a number is divisible by 3 and prints "Fizz". However, it should check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 and print "FizzBuzz".

The second elif statement checks if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, but it will never be executed because the first if statement already catches numbers divisible by 3. Therefore, you should switch the order of the first two if statements.
